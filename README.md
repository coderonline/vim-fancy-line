# vim-fancy-line

This statusline is kept minimalistic and easy to understand. Its main feature
is, that it uses Vims highlight groups correctly and displays the status-
and tab-bar after the definitions in the currently selected colorscheme.
That means, that the highlight groups `StatusLine`, `StatusLineNC`,
`StatusLineTerm` and `StatusLineTermNC` are considered. Otherwise the bars
look similar to powerline, but that is no wonder, because the `î‚°` symbol
is the only one, which used to be available in code page 437 and thus broadly
compatible.
